# whats-spoofing

Reply spoofer for WhatsApp messages.

## Installation

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Ismaelbrendo/whats-spoofing
 cd whats-spoofing
 mkdir -p data && mkdir -p db && mkdir -p history
 go mod download
 go build
```

## Usage

```bash
 ./whats-spoofing
```

Once you see a QR code on the terminal, scan it with your WhatsApp app just like when you login on WhatsApp web. \
This is necessary to get the session token to send messages. 

You will see a form to send messages. \
Fill the form with the phone number (with the international prefix but without +) you want to send the message to, the number of the user to spoof (the number that will appear on the message), the spoofed reply message and the reply, sent by you. \
If you want to send a spoofed message to a group, just copy and paste the group ID (which you can get below the sender form) on the first phone number input. \
Click on the `Send` button and the message will be sent.

example: send-spoofed-reply 0000000000 output 0000000000 hey man|hello brother

Replace the numbers with the victim's full number, and the last messages with the message you will reply to, and your message

Happy spoofing! ðŸŽ‰
